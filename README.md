# Project summary
The project is an intelligent LED lighting system with integrated cooling and tracking functionality. It uses an Arduino to control an LED light, a fan for cooling, and a servo motor for movement. 
The LED's temperature is monitored by a sensor, and the fan adjusts its speed based on the temperature to prevent overheating. Additionally, the LED can rotate up to 170Â° using a servo motor, while two ultrasonic sensors allow the system to track objects or people by moving the light in their direction.

A display provides real time feedback on temperature and system status, controlled by four buttons arranged like a joystick. The system has multiple modes that can be selected via the display, such as adjusting the LED angle or cooling settings.

The work has been completed, including the design, assembly, and coding. The entire structure, consisting of 3D printed components and the integration of sensors, has been successfully assembled. The cooling and tracking functions are operational, and the servo motor for LED movement works as expected.
